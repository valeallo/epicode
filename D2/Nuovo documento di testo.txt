For the focaccia:

4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 3/4 cups (350g) lukewarm water
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan
For the topping:

3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, for brushing on top
10 ounces brie, cut into cubes (scrape rind off with a paring knife if desired, though itâ€™s not necessary)
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary

Method
Make the dough:
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour.

Cover and let it rise for 1-2 hours at room temperature. Use it right away, or transfer to the fridge overnight.
